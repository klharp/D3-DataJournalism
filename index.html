          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>

          <p>
            The <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs" target="_blank">American Community Survey
              (ACS)</a>
            helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses understand the changes taking place in their
            communities. It is a premier source for detailed population and housing information. This is a dataset from
            2014 with data on state's rates of poverty, age, income, healthcare, obesity, and smoking.
          </p>

          <h5>Some Observations</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>States with a higher poverty rate tend to also have a population that has a higher percentage of smokers
              and those that are obese. The obesity and smoking data clusters in the age range of 30s to mid 40s.</li>
            <li>The states with the higher percentages lacking healthcare and in poverty are located in the southern and
              southeastern U.S. </li>
            <li>The states with the lower percentages lacking healthcare and in poverty are located in the northern and
              northeastern U.S.</li>
            <li>The average age for persons all health risks are clustered in the 30s to mid 40s -- the time after
              being on parent's health plan and before Medicare/Medicaid.</li>
            <li>There is a correlation between average household income and percent in poverty.</li>
          </ul>
